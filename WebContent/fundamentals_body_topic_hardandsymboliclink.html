<h3>Link to other file on the system</h3>

<h4>Symbolic link :-</h4>

Like windows short link.<br>
Symbolic link can create across the file system.<br>
Symb link have full permission but ultimatly this have only target permission and will not provide full permission to edit.<br><br>

#ln -s taget link_name<br>
#ln -s /etc/motd motd1<br>
#rm motd1 --> this won't harm the original file<br>
#rm /etc/motd --> this will broke the motd link file<br>

<h4>Hard link :-</h4>

Link to specific inode location on our file system..Hard link can be created inside the same file system.<br><br>

If you change the permission to one file and also automatically change to other file.<br>
Remove original file wont affect hard link file because it link to the inode.<br><br>

#ln motd motd1<br>
